      <p>&emsp;Laissez.fit is an idea inspired by many others. 
        It is a fusion of Laissez-faire economics, which is the 
        idea that the economy takes care of itself. It is also 
        the idea that we as people are lazier than we have ever 
        been. With so much done for us, we are busy with "Lazy" 
        activities. 
        <br/><br/>
        &emsp;This is a great thing, but it can sometimes 
        endanger our health. This is where Laissez.fit comes in. 
        Read about lazy fitness in our articles and where ever 
        else you can find it. Track your fitness goals to 
        discover where you stand each day. Monitor your metrics 
        to see that you are in the shape you want to be in. Do 
        it the Laissez way.</p>
